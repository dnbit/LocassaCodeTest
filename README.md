# LocassaCodeTest

## Introduction

You are required to create a native application to display your current location on a map annotated with the current weather condition. Please provide a fully working project including all files and resources required to run successfully.

Please check the code compiles before submitting.

## Duration

This test should take a maximum of 2 hours to complete.

## The Problem

1. Display a map showing the users current location in the centre of the screen. (Leave a gap around the map showing the background).

2. Use the [Yahoo Weather API](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather) to retrieve the weather for the users current location.

3. Display the current weather details based on the returned data in a nice format.

4. Set the background colour behind the map in accordance with how warm or cold the temperature is.

5. Allow the user to pan the map and retrieve the new weather for that location.

6. Handle any errors gracefully.
